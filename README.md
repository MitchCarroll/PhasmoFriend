## Basic Instruction

![](./Images/GIFs/PhasmoFriend_Example.gif)

### Select a difficulty level

Click on the 'Difficulty Level' button at the top left. This is needed even on professional to start the count-up timer/total timer. Press the 'Start' button once you have unlocked the door of the house.

### Change your Sanity

There are three ways, the various ways are meant to accommodate for different hunting scenarios

- Click on the sanity value and scroll up/down on your mouse (if on desktop)
- Click the up and down arrows to the right of the sanity value
- Click on the sanity value and enter in a new value with your keyboard

### Enter in the ghosts name

Click on the entry box to the right of the ghosts name and type in either the full or whole name of the ghost

### Restart the total timer

You may want to restart the total timer to count up in certain scenarios, say you just used a smudge stick and you wanted to keep track of how long it had been since you used that item. Just press the restart button next to the large count-up timer and the time will be brought back to 00:00:00.

### Entering in Evidence Quickly

Double click/tap on the evidence photo to select the evidence. You will know that the evidence is selected once the evidence image has a light green background. Only three evidence items may be selected. Each time a new evidence is selected, the possible outcomes List will be updated, along with the evidence needed for those outcomes.

### Starting the app fresh

If you've accidently entered the wrong Difficulty level, the hunt has been completed and you would like to hunt again, or another scenario arises that makes you want to refresh the application and set everything to how it was when the app was started, press the 'New Hunt' button at the bottom right of the screen.

### Show and Hide Notes

Press the 'Show Notes' button to display the current notes. These notes can be used to keep track of important objectives or note helpful observations during a hunt. Examples of this are "Smudge the Ghost Room", "Ghost reacts to multiple people", or "Ghost not in basement". Use it as you like! To hide the notes once you have written what you wanted to write, press the same button you pressed to show the notes which now displays 'Hide Notes'.

### Shortcuts

- Press 'ctrl + alt' to quickly show your notes
- Press 'ctrl + shift' to quickly restart the count-up timer

### Things you should know

- The total timer will not start counting up until the difficulty timer has counted down to 0 (so on professional the count-up will start as soon as start is pressed)
- The difficulty count-down timer will change colors as time goes down so you can see through the corner of your eye that the setup time is almost over
- There will be more functionality in the future that I am currently working on, such as a cleaner interface, the ability to track different challenges, track photo types, etc. Please request changes you would like to see.
- This application was made in Godot, if you would like to build this application and not rely on my exports, this can easily be done by loading the project into godot and running it.
- I will release official versions of this app for FREE on the Apple and Android App Stores once I can put money aside to do so.
- I appreciate you all and I hope you enjoy PhasmoFriend.
